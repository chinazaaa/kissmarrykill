# fateround — AWS Infrastructure (Terraform)

Terraform stack that provisions, **in your own AWS account and region** (for control and data residency), the infrastructure to run the `fateround` Next.js 16 app as a Docker container on EC2 behind an Application Load Balancer.

Supabase remains the managed backend. **This stack does not create a database** — it only stands up the compute, networking, image registry, config storage, and the scheduled "tick" job that the app needs.

## What this creates

- **VPC** (`network.tf`) with public + private subnets spread across `az_count` Availability Zones, an Internet Gateway, and a **single NAT gateway** (cost trade-off — see [Cost note](#cost-note)) for private-subnet outbound (ECR pulls, SSM, Supabase).
- **Application Load Balancer** (`alb.tf`) in the public subnets, with an HTTP listener (and an optional HTTPS listener + HTTP→HTTPS redirect when `enable_https` is set). Health checks hit `/`.
- **Auto Scaling Group** (`compute.tf`) of Amazon Linux 2023 EC2 instances in the **private** subnets. Each instance boots from a launch template whose user-data (`templates/user-data.sh.tftpl`) installs Docker, logs in to ECR, reads config from SSM Parameter Store, and runs the app container. IMDSv2 is required.
- **ECR repository** (`ecr.tf`) for the app image, with scan-on-push and a lifecycle policy that keeps the last 10 images. `force_delete` is enabled.
- **SSM Parameter Store** app config (`secrets.tf`):
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` — `String`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — `SecureString`
  - `CRON_SECRET` — `SecureString`
- **IAM instance role** (`iam.tf`): ECR auth + pull (scoped to this repo), read of this app's SSM parameters, `kms:Decrypt` restricted to SSM, and SSM Session Manager access (no SSH keys / bastion).
- **EventBridge Scheduler → Lambda** (`scheduler.tf`, `lambda/tick/index.mjs`): on `tick_schedule`, a Lambda POSTs to `/api/describe-it/tick` with the `CRON_SECRET` as a Bearer token. This replaces the Vercel cron that the Hobby plan could not run. The endpoint is idempotent and only acts on sessions past their deadline.

> **Database:** none of this provisions a database. Supabase stays as the managed backend; the app talks to it directly using the SSM-stored values.

## Prerequisites

- **Terraform** >= 1.5 (`versions.tf` pins the AWS provider `~> 5.40` and `archive ~> 2.4`).
- **AWS credentials / profile** with permission to create the resources above, and a target region.
- **Docker** — to build and push the app image to ECR.
- **(HTTPS, recommended)** an **ACM certificate** in the same region plus a **domain** you can point at the ALB.
- **Strongly recommended:** configure the **S3 remote backend** (commented out in `versions.tf`) with a DynamoDB lock table before any real/shared use. The default is local state.

## Deploy steps

### a. Configure variables

```bash
cd infra
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# edit terraform.tfvars: supabase_url, supabase_anon_key, cron_secret, region, etc.
```

### b. Init & plan

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
```

### c. Apply

```bash
terraform apply
```

Note the outputs — especially **`ecr_repository_url`** (where to push the image) and **`alb_dns_name`** (for DNS).

### d. Build & push the image to ECR

Build from the **repo root** `Dockerfile`, passing the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` build args (Next.js inlines them at build time), tag to match `app_image_tag` (default `latest`), then log in and push.

```bash
# From the repo root (one directory up from infra/)
ACCOUNT_ID=<account-id>
REGION=<region>
ECR_URL=$(terraform -chdir=infra output -raw ecr_repository_url)
TAG=latest   # must match var.app_image_tag

# Authenticate Docker to ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region "$REGION" \
  | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "$ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com"

# Build with the public Supabase build args
docker build \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co" \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="<anon-key>" \
  -t "$ECR_URL:$TAG" .

# Push
docker push "$ECR_URL:$TAG"
```

### e. Roll out

Instances pull the image on boot. To roll out a **new** image, push the tag again, then either:

```bash
terraform apply
```

or trigger an ASG **instance refresh** so instances are replaced and pull the new image:

```bash
aws autoscaling start-instance-refresh --auto-scaling-group-name fateround-asg
```

### f. DNS & HTTPS

Point your domain's CNAME/ALIAS at the **`alb_dns_name`** output. For HTTPS, provision an ACM cert in `aws_region`, then set in `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
enable_https        = true
acm_certificate_arn = "arn:aws:acm:<region>:<account-id>:certificate/..."
app_base_url        = "https://play.example.com"
```

and re-apply. `app_base_url` is also used by the tick scheduler; if empty it falls back to the ALB over HTTP.

## Operating

- **Shell access (no SSH):** instances are managed via SSM Session Manager.

  ```bash
  aws ssm start-session --target <instance-id>
  ```

- **Logs:**
  - Boot / user-data: `/var/log/user-data.log`
  - App container: `docker logs app`
- **Tick job:** the Lambda function name is the **`tick_lambda_name`** output; the schedule is `tick_schedule` (default `rate(1 minute)`).

## Cost note

Rough monthly ballpark (region-dependent, on-demand):

| Item | Approx. |
| --- | --- |
| Application Load Balancer | ~$16+ |
| NAT gateway | ~$32+ (plus data processing) |
| 2× `t3.small` instances | ~$30 |
| Data transfer | extra |

This stack uses a **single NAT gateway** to keep cost down. The trade-off is that NAT is not highly available across AZs — if that AZ has trouble, private-subnet outbound is affected. Moving to one NAT per AZ improves HA but raises cost (another ~$32+/month per additional NAT).

## Teardown

```bash
terraform destroy
```

ECR `force_delete` is enabled, so the repository and **all images in it are removed** on destroy.

## Security notes

- App instances are **only reachable from the ALB** on the app port (`app_port`, default 3000); they sit in private subnets with no inbound from the internet.
- **IMDSv2 is required** (`http_tokens = "required"`), mitigating SSRF-to-credential theft.
- Secrets live in **SSM SecureString** parameters; the instance role can `kms:Decrypt` only via SSM and can read only this app's parameter path.
- The **`CRON_SECRET`** stored in SSM must match the value the app expects, since the tick Lambda authenticates to `/api/describe-it/tick` with it as a Bearer token.
